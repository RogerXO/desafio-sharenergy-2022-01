# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

That application is too easy to use!

### `npm start`

You just need to use "npm start" to view the application running in your browese at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

!!! That way you will run the app in the development mode. !!!

## App Video

You can watch a short video where I explain the app usage and the code
